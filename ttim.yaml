description: An example how types and traces can be defined in T-Reqs.

types:
# ###
# Requirements are in fact system requirements: A condition or capability that must be 
# met by treqs to satisfy its intended use (which we aim to express through stakeholder 
# requirements, see below).
- name: requirement
  links:
#   ##
#   Requirements may relate to any other treqs element and this can be expressed through
#   the relatesTo trace link. 
#   They can also be a refinement of another requirements, which can be expressed 
#   through the hasParent linktype
#   Finally, they should directly or indirectly (e.g. through a parent) be motivated by 
#   a stakeholder-requirement
  - type: relatesTo
  - type: parent
    target: requirement
  - type: hasParent
    target: requirement
  - type: addresses
    target: stakeholder-requirement
# ###
# Stakeholder needs describe a challenge that key stakeholders of treqs have. 
- name: stakeholder-need
# We do not anticipate the need to trace from stakeholder needs to any elements.
  links: []
# ##
# Stakeholder requirements are requirements from a stakeholder's point of view and 
# capture our understanding on why somebody would like to use a tool such as treqs
- name: stakeholder-requirement
  links:
#   ##
#   Stakeholder requirements are often motivated by stakeholder needs; in fact, they are
#   our interpretation of what is needed to solve the stakeholder's problem
#   Stakeholder requirements can also relate to other stakeholder requirements.
  - type: addresses
    target: stakeholder-need
  - type: relatesTo
    target: stakeholder-requirement
# ###
# Unittests are automatic tests that check whether a unit of the code works as intended.
- name: unittest
  links:
#   ##
#   Unittests can relate to any treqs element (linktype: relatesTo).
#   They can also be a refinement of another test (linktype: hasParent).
#   They may test an aspect of a requirements (linktype: tests).
  - type: relatesTo
  - type: hasParent
    target: unittest
  - type: tests
    required: 'true'
    target:
      - requirement
# ###
# Information provides additional background or context, but is not a requirement by 
# itself. 
- name: information
  links:
#   ##
#   Information can relate to any other treqs element.
  - type: relatesTo
